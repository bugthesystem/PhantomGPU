# PhantomGPU Roadmap

## Current Status ‚úÖ

**Core Features Complete:**
- Multi-framework support (TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, HuggingFace)
- Real hardware modeling with TOML configuration
- Multi-GPU performance comparison
- Cost analysis and GPU recommendations
- CLI interface with comprehensive features

**Framework Support:**
- ‚úÖ TensorFlow (SavedModel, frozen graphs, TensorFlow Lite, Keras)
- ‚úÖ ONNX models
- ‚úÖ HuggingFace Hub integration
- ‚úÖ PyTorch (basic support)

**Hardware Modeling:**
- ‚úÖ 10+ production GPUs (V100, A100, RTX 4090, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Custom GPU definitions via TOML
- ‚úÖ Thermal and memory modeling
- ‚úÖ Precision support (FP32, FP16, INT8)

## Phase 1: Accessibility (Next 6 weeks)

### Web Interface üåê
**Goal**: Browser-based GPU emulation
- WASM compilation of core engine
- Interactive model comparison interface
- TOML profile editor
- No installation required

### REST API üîå
**Goal**: Integration with existing ML workflows
- JSON-based model comparison endpoints
- Service mode with hot profile reloading
- Authentication and rate limiting
- Prometheus metrics

### Dynamic GPU Support üîß
**Goal**: Remove CLI limitations
- Load any GPU name from TOML profiles
- Runtime GPU discovery
- Better error messages for missing profiles

## Phase 2: Enterprise Features (Following 8 weeks)

### Automated Reports üìä
- PDF/HTML benchmark reports
- Executive summaries with recommendations
- Cost analysis and ROI calculations
- Customizable report templates

### Enhanced Cloud Integration üí∞
- Real-time pricing from AWS/GCP/Azure APIs
- Spot instance optimization
- Multi-region cost analysis
- Budget alerts and recommendations

### CI/CD Integration üöÄ
- GitHub Actions for performance testing
- Regression detection in CI pipelines
- Performance baselines and trending
- Automated performance comments on PRs

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)

### AI-Powered Optimization üß†
- Automated model optimization suggestions
- Batch size and precision recommendations
- Hardware-model matching algorithms

### Energy & Sustainability üå±
- Power consumption modeling
- Carbon footprint analysis
- Green deployment recommendations

## Not Planned

We explicitly avoid these to maintain focus:
- Game/graphics workloads (ML-focused only)
- Real GPU monitoring (prediction-focused)
- Multiple configuration formats (TOML is sufficient)
- Distributed system complexity (keep core simple)
- 
## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for development guidelines.

Priority areas for contributions:
1. Web interface development (TypeScript/React)
2. Cloud provider API integrations
3. Additional ML framework support
4. Documentation and examples
